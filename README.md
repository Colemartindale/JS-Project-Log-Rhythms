# This here is Log Rhythms, the beat sequencer!

Log Rhythms is a beat sequencer with several drum kit presets for anyone to make catchy and unique beats. The sequences loops while users select what and when a sound is played during the 8 bars given. Log Rhythms includes a normal drum kit and a not-so-normal drum kit made especially for fans of Super Smash Bros.

## Technologies, Libraries and APIs

Log Rhythms is made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. CSS will be used to style everything while HTML will be used to structure the layout for the app. JavaScript is be used for the logical operations and functonality. 

Tone.js library was used to seamlessly implement the looping of the sequencer with the scheduleRepeat function.
