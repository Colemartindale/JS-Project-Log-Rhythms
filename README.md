# This here is Suave Sequences, the beat sequencer!

Suave Sequences is a beat sequencer with several drumkit presets for anyone to make catchy and unique beats. The sequences loops while users select what and when a sound is played during the 8 bars given. Suave Sequences includes a normal drumkit and a not-so-normal drum kit made especially for fans of Super Smash Bros.

[Take a look here!](https://github.com/Colemartindale/Suave-Sequences-JS-Project-)

In Suave Sequences, users will be able to:

-Program which noises play at what time during the 8 bars by selecting a box that triggers the sound.
-Select the tempo at which the beat will loop.
-Switch between drum kits for different and fun sounds.
-Visualize the audio waveforms created by their original beats.

In addition, this project will include:

-Playback buttons such as play, pause and clear for seemless editing and creation.
-A volume knob for users to crank their beats up or down depending on how they like it!

## Technologies, Libraries and APIs

Suave Sequences will be made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. CSS will be used to style everything while HTML will be used to structure the layout for the app. JavaScript will be used for the logical operations and functonality. 

I may be using the Tone.js library for BPM(beats per minute) functionality and sound generation. This depends on whether or not I can figure out how to include audio files of my own. 

Howler.js may be useful to me as well. Howler.js offers a reliable API for using JavaScript audio, giving controls like play, pause, fade and loop. The most applicable feature of Howler.js for this particular app though is it automatically caches audio files in order to improve playback performance. I will definitely need this in order to have a smooth loop of audio files running.
